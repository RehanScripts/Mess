## 💡 Important Notes

1. **One Attendance Per Meal Per Day**
   - You can have 3 attendance records per day (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)

   - Automatic: When you book → Attendance marked "Present"
   - Manual: Admin can change or add attendance later

3. **Booking = Attendance**
   - Every meal booking automatically creates an attendance record
   - No need to separately mark attendance

4. **Late Arrivals**
   - If you arrive late, inform the admin
   - Admin can change your status from "Present" to "Late"
