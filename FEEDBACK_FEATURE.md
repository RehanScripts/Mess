# Student Feedback Feature Implementation

## Summary
Added a complete feedback system for students to submit feedback that appears in the admin dashboard. Students can submit feedback through a dedicated page, view their feedback history, and admins can see all feedback submissions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend API (server.js)

#### New Student Endpoints Added:

**POST `/api/feedback`** - Submit feedback (Students)
- Authenticated endpoint for students
- Automatically captures user ID from JWT token
- Fetches student name from database
- Creates feedback with "pending" status
- Required fields: feedback_type, subject, message
- Optional field: rating (1-5 stars)

**GET `/api/feedback/my`** - View own feedback (Students)
- Students can view their own feedback history
- Shows all feedback submitted by the logged-in student
- Ordered by most recent first
- Returns: feedback_type, subject, message, rating, status, created_at, resolved_at

### 2. New Student Page: `feedback.html`

#### Features:
✅ **Feedback Submission Form**
- Feedback Type dropdown (General, Food Quality, Service, Cleanliness, Other)
- Subject input field
- Message textarea
- Star rating selector (1-5 stars, optional)
- Submit button

✅ **Interactive Star Rating**

- Auto-hides after 5 seconds

✅ **Feedback History Section**
- Displays all user's previously submitted feedback
- Shows feedback type with color-coded badges
- Shows status (Pending, Reviewed, Resolved)
- Displays date, subject, message, and rating
- Empty state when no feedback exists

✅ **Responsive Design**
- Mobile-friendly layout

- Beautiful UI with proper spacing

### 3. Navigation Updates

#### Added "Feedback" link to all student pages:
- ✅ `dashboard.html`
- ✅ `book_meals.html`
- ✅ `my_attendance.html`
- ✅ `transactions.html`
- ✅ `settings.html`

**Navigation Structure (Student):**
- Dashboard
- Book Meals
- My Attendance
- Transactions
- **Feedback** ⭐ (NEW)
- Settings
- Logout

## How It Works

### Student Flow:
1. Student logs in
2. Clicks "Feedback" in sidebar
3. Fills out feedback form:
   - Selects feedback type
   - Enters subject and message
   - Optionally rates (1-5 stars)
4. Clicks "Submit Feedback"
5. Sees success message
6. Feedback appears in their history
7. Can view all their past feedback

### Admin Flow:
1. Admin logs into admin dashboard
2. Views "Feedback Management" section
3. Sees all student feedback submissions
4. Can view, edit, update status
5. Can mark as "reviewed" or "resolved"
6. Can add responses/notes

## Feedback Types

The system supports 5 feedback types:
- **General Feedback** - General comments

## Feedback Status

Feedback progresses through statuses:

## API Endpoints

### Student Endpoints:

```
GET /api/admin/feedback
GET /api/admin/feedback/:id

## Security
