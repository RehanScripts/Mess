## Database Migration Notes

The database tables are created automatically when the server starts. If you already have a running database:

1. Stop the server
2. Delete the `data/db.sqlite` file (backup first if needed)
3. Restart the server - tables will be recreated with seed data

Alternatively, the tables will be added to existing database without data loss.
