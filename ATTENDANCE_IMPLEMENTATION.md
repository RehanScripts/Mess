# Attendance System Implementation Summary

## âœ… What Has Been Added

### 1. **Automatic Attendance Marking**
When a student books a meal, their attendance is automatically recorded:
- **Status**: Present
- **Date**: Booking date
- **Meal Type**: Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner
- **Notes**: "Auto-marked via booking"

### 2. **Backend API Endpoints**

#### For Students:
- `GET /api/attendance/my` - Get your own attendance records
  - Query params: `start_date`, `end_date`, `meal_type`
  - Returns: List of attendance records

- `GET /api/attendance/my/stats` - Get attendance statistics
  - Returns: Present/Absent/Late counts, percentage, meal-wise breakdown

#### For Admins:
- All existing admin attendance endpoints remain functional
- `GET /api/admin/attendance` - View all student attendance
- `POST /api/admin/attendance` - Manually add attendance
- `PUT /api/admin/attendance/:id` - Update attendance status
- `DELETE /api/admin/attendance/:id` - Remove attendance record

#### Booking System:
- `POST /api/bookings` - Create new meal booking
  - **Automatically creates attendance record**
  - Creates transaction record
  - Returns booking confirmation

### 3. **Student Attendance Portal** (`my_attendance.html`)

Features:
- **Statistics Dashboard**
  - Present days count

### 4. **Admin Features**

   - **Marks attendance as "Present"**
   - Creates transaction record
   - Shows confirmation

2. Scrolls to "Attendance Management" section
3. Can:
